# Hello Firekast 🚀

This simple app demonstrates how easy it is to use the [Firekast](https://firekast.io/) Live Stream Android SDK.

1. Git clone this project
2. Modify `App.kt` with your credentials. *Visit Firekast [Dashboard](https://dashboard.firekast.io/) if you don't have yet.*
3. Run the code on your favorite mobile device

Within the app, make a live stream in the first tab (the longer the better 😎). When you are done watch your live in the second tab. Note, the player is able to play either live or VOD, it automagically figures it out.

Happy live stream!  🎥
